This fork makes `audiocraft` installable easily by other packages, tests on various versions of modern `torch`, and removes the dependency on `xformers`, making it compatible with **macOS**.

AudioCraft is a PyTorch library for deep learning research on audio generation. AudioCraft contains inference and training code
for two state-of-the-art AI generative models producing high-quality audio: AudioGen and MusicGen.


## Installation

Install `uv`. Then:

```shell
uv pip install --torch-backend=auto "audiocraft[dev,wm]@git+https://git@github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft"
```

We also recommend having `ffmpeg` installed, either through your system or Anaconda:

**Linux**:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
```

**macOS**:

```shell
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Windows**:

Install Chocolatey. Then:

```shell
choco install -y ffmpeg
```

## Models

At the moment, AudioCraft contains the training code and inference code for:
* [MusicGen](./docs/MUSICGEN.md): A state-of-the-art controllable text-to-music model.
* [AudioGen](./docs/AUDIOGEN.md): A state-of-the-art text-to-sound model.
* [EnCodec](./docs/ENCODEC.md): A state-of-the-art high fidelity neural audio codec.
* [Multi Band Diffusion](./docs/MBD.md): An EnCodec compatible decoder using diffusion.
* [MAGNeT](./docs/MAGNET.md): A state-of-the-art non-autoregressive model for text-to-music and text-to-sound.
* [AudioSeal](./docs/WATERMARKING.md): A state-of-the-art audio watermarking.
* [MusicGen Style](./docs/MUSICGEN_STYLE.md): A state-of-the-art text-and-style-to-music model.
* [JASCO](./docs/JASCO.md): "High quality text-to-music model conditioned on chords, melodies and drum tracks"


## Training code

AudioCraft contains PyTorch components for deep learning research in audio and training pipelines for the developed models.
For a general introduction of AudioCraft design principles and instructions to develop your own training pipeline, refer to
the [AudioCraft training documentation](./docs/TRAINING.md).

For reproducing existing work and using the developed training pipelines, refer to the instructions for each specific model
that provides pointers to configuration, example grids and model/task-specific information and FAQ.


## API documentation

We provide some [API documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/audiocraft/api_docs/audiocraft/index.html) for AudioCraft.


## FAQ

#### Is the training code available?

Yes! We provide the training code for [EnCodec](./docs/ENCODEC.md), [MusicGen](./docs/MUSICGEN.md),[Multi Band Diffusion](./docs/MBD.md) and [JASCO](./docs/JASCO.md).

#### Where are the models stored?

Hugging Face stored the model in a specific location, which can be overridden by setting the `AUDIOCRAFT_CACHE_DIR` environment variable for the AudioCraft models.
In order to change the cache location of the other Hugging Face models, please check out the [Hugging Face Transformers documentation for the cache setup](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#cache-setup).
Finally, if you use a model that relies on Demucs (e.g. `musicgen-melody`) and want to change the download location for Demucs, refer to the [Torch Hub documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/hub.html#where-are-my-downloaded-models-saved).
